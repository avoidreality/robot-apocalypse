# Robot Apocalypse 

Hello World!

Thanks for visiting my repository. This is my first game to create with Unity3D and I hope this is not the last game. 
The game in it's current state will overload your random access memory (RAM). This is because objects are instantiated endlessly into infinity. 
To play the game import that unitpackage file. 

Peace, Happy and Game On!
