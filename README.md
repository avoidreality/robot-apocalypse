# Robot Apocalypse 

Hello World!

Thanks for visiting my repository. This is my first game to create with Unity3D and I hope this is not the last game. 

The game in it's current state might  overload your random access memory (RAM). This is because objects are instantiated endlessly into infinity. But maybe not asI made some changes decreasing the amount of power-ups spawned. 

To play the game import 1 of the  unitypackage files. The version created on 4/18/2024 will spawn an incredible amount of powerups that could kill your computerfrom all the RAM used up by object instantiation. 

Peace, Happy and Game On!
