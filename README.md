# Robot Apocalypse 

Hello World!

Thanks for visiting my repository. This is my first game to create with Unity3D. This is my primate reaction to the AI revolution. Though helpful I fear AI has taken my job and is going to melt my brain. I know that AI has made my life easier however. For instance, chatGPT helped me with making pieces of this game. In the game you get to destroy AI robots trying to take over the Earth! This is not a brainy chess game even though the default floor is a checker-board I created with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). 

The game is about 90% complete. To test the game load the 5-9-2024-90PercentComplete-RobotApocalypse.unitypackage in your Unity instance please. Earlier versions of the game are also available. 
In the present incarnation the robots are just large red rectangles. :D I need to add to the game so the robots look more like a robot. 

Peace, Happy and Game On!
